# Tech Stack

LangChain + FastAPI + PostgreSQL + pgvector + React

A monolithic Python backend built with FastAPI hosts all LangChain agents (Profiler, Orchestrator, Secondary, Simulation Engine) and exposes REST endpoints to a React single-page application. PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension serves as both the relational store for document metadata, version labels, and simulation inputs, and as the vector store for RAG retrieval. This option minimises infrastructure complexity and is the fastest path to a working end-to-end prototype.

- **Pro:** Single deployable unit; minimal DevOps overhead
- **Pro:** pgvector eliminates a separate vector-database dependency
- **Pro:** LangChain agent chains and RAG pipelines coexist in one codebase
- **Pro:** FastAPI async support handles concurrent chat sessions adequately at low-to-medium load
- **Con:** All agents share the same process; a spike in simulation requests can starve conversational agents
- **Con:** Scaling requires vertical growth or full-service replication rather than per-component scaling
- **Con:** Document ingestion pipeline runs in-process, risking request timeouts on large uploads
